# Top50_Crypto
The objective of this project is to fetch live cryptocurrency data for the top 50 cryptocurrencies, store it in a MySQL database, and analyze it by connecting the database to Power BI. 
The data will be dynamically updated and visualized in Power BI to present live cryptocurrency prices, market capitalization, 24-hour price changes, and trading volumes.
**Follow these steps to get the data:**

1. Use a **Python script** to fetch cryptocurrency data from the API (e.g., CoinGecko or Binance) and load it into a SQL database.
2. Connect **Power BI** to the SQL database.
3. Create **visualizations** in Power BI to display live cryptocurrency metrics.
4. Schedule data updates in Power BI (e.g., every 5 or 10 minutes)
