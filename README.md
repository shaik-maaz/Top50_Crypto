# Top50_Crypto
The objective of this project is to fetch live cryptocurrency data for the top 50 cryptocurrencies, store it in a MySQL database, and analyze it by connecting the database to Power BI. 
The data will be dynamically updated and visualized in Power BI to present live cryptocurrency prices, market capitalization, 24-hour price changes, and trading volumes.

**Follow these steps to get the data:**

 **Step 1: Prepare Your MySQL Database**
1. Ensure the MySQL Server is Running
- Test your connection by querying the database through a client like MySQL Workbench.
2. Note Connection Details:
   - **Host**: (e.g., `localhost` or an IP address)
   - **Port**: Default is `3306`
   - **Database Name**: (e.g., `crypto_data`)
   - **Username**: (e.g., `root`)
   - **Password**: (your database password)
